## üöÄ 30-Day Coding Challenge: Day 6

This project is the sixth entry in my 30-day coding challenge. The objective was to build a functional and visually appealing tool for developers by interacting with a real-world, professional API. The app allows users to search for any GitHub profile and retrieve key information and recent activity.

### üìñ Project Overview

The GitHub Profile Finder is a sleek, single-page application that fetches and displays data from the official GitHub REST API. Users can enter a GitHub username to see a well-structured view of the profile, including their avatar, bio, follower counts, and their 10 most recently created public repositories.

A major focus of this project was creating a high-quality user experience with a professional, developer-centric "dark mode" UI, instant search, and efficient data loading.

### ‚ú® Live Demo & Screenshot

### üåü Key Features

* **Live API Integration:** Fetches real-time data directly from the official GitHub REST API.
* **Efficient Data Fetching:** Uses `Promise.all()` to make parallel API calls for user details and repositories, significantly improving loading performance.
* **Dynamic UI Rendering:** The entire profile and repository list is generated dynamically in JavaScript based on the API response.
* **Professional Dark Mode UI:** Aesthetically pleasing dark theme inspired by GitHub's own design language, providing a familiar and comfortable experience for developers.
* **Latest Repository List:** Displays the user's 10 most recent public repositories, sorted by creation date.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Provides clear feedback to the user if the username is not found or if there is a network error.
* **Fully Responsive:** The layout seamlessly adapts to all screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.

### üíª Technologies Used

### üéØ Learning Objectives

This project was an excellent opportunity to practice several important front-end development skills:

* **Working with a Professional API:** Making `GET` requests, handling responses, and parsing JSON data.
* **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Mastering `async/await` and leveraging `Promise.all` for performance optimization.
* **Complex DOM Manipulation:** Building a multi-component UI entirely from JavaScript based on API data.
* **UI/UX Design:** Focusing on creating a visually appealing and intuitive interface with a specific audience (developers) in mind.
* **Responsive Design with Grid:** Using CSS Grid to create a complex layout that adapts gracefully to different screen sizes.
